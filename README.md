# NFL Big Data Bowl - Predicting Offensive Formations and Player Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project leverages data from the NFL Big Data Bowl to analyze player movements, predict offensive formations, and provide insights into team performance. By combining machine learning and deep learning techniques, I explore the dynamics of football gameplay and enhance player analysis.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed large-scale datasets from NFL games, plays, and tracking data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted meaningful features such as speed, acceleration, and formation labels.
- **Model Training**: Built and trained a custom SportsTransformer model to predict offensive formations.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Analyzed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
- **Visualization**: Created visual representations of player movement, team performance, and play dynamics.


### Outputs:
- Performance metrics.
- Interactive player movement visualizations.
- Detailed HTML reports summarizing findings.

## Results:
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting offensive formations.
- Gained insights into player dynamics and performance through advanced visualizations.
- Provided actionable reports for deeper analysis.
